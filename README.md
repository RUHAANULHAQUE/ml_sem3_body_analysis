# ml_sem3_body_analysis by ruhaan ul haque


This Python script uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to analyze your body language in real-time from a webcam or video file.

It's designed with a "Super Forgiving Mode," so you don't have to be a professional mime to get it to recognize gestures like "Steeple," "Holding Ball," or "The Box." The tool tracks your posture score and gesture frequency, providing instant on-screen feedback.

When you're done, it exports a detailed CSV report and a text summary of your session.
